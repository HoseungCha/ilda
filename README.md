The project is an attempt to implement the Incremental Linear Discriminant Analysis from the 2005 paper of Shaoning Pang et al.
Additionally a variant of Weighted ILDA which uses Weighted Pairwise Fischer Criteria is also implemented which is our proposed method.

For the testing, we have used several face datasets publicly available such as AR, CACD, Yale B, FERET, ORL. These images are loaded as numpy array and are trained over the models.
